# User-Specific Data Implementation Guide

## Overview
Your application has been completely updated to be user-specific. Each authenticated user will only see and manage their own data (herbs, formulas, patients, and prescriptions).

## What's Been Implemented

### 1. Database Level Security
- **Row Level Security (RLS)** enabled on all tables
- **User-specific policies** ensure users can only access their own data
- **Automatic filtering** by `user_id` on all queries

### 2. API Level Security
- All API functions now include user authentication checks
- **Automatic user_id injection** on all create operations
- **User-specific filtering** on all read operations
- **User-specific updates and deletes**

### 3. Frontend Level Security
- **User-specific data hooks** (`useUserData`)
- **Automatic data scoping** to current user
- **Secure query keys** that include user ID
- **Real-time data invalidation** when user changes

## Database Changes

### Tables Updated
- `herbs` - Added `user_id` column with RLS policies
- `formulas` - Added `user_id` column with RLS policies  
- `patients` - Added `user_id` column with RLS policies
- `prescriptions` - Added `user_id` column with RLS policies

### RLS Policies
Each table has 4 policies:
- **SELECT**: Users can only view their own records
- **INSERT**: Users can only insert records with their user_id
- **UPDATE**: Users can only update their own records
- **DELETE**: Users can only delete their own records

## API Changes

### All API Functions Now:
1. **Check authentication** before any operation
2. **Filter by user_id** on all queries
3. **Include user_id** on all inserts
4. **Validate ownership** on updates/deletes

### Example API Flow:
```typescript
// Before: Could access any data
const herbs = await supabase.from('herbs').select('*')

// After: Only user's data
const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser()
const herbs = await supabase
  .from('herbs')
  .select('*')
  .eq('user_id', user.id)
```

## Frontend Changes

### New Hook: `useUserData`
```typescript
const { 
  herbs,           // User's herbs only
  formulas,        // User's formulas only
  patients,        // User's patients only
  prescriptions,   // User's prescriptions only
  stats,           // User's statistics
  invalidateAll    // Refresh all user data
} = useUserData()
```

### Updated Components
- **Dashboard**: Shows user-specific statistics
- **Herbs Page**: Only displays user's herbs
- **Formulas Page**: Only displays user's formulas
- **Patients Page**: Only displays user's patients
- **Prescriptions Page**: Only displays user's prescriptions

## Security Features

### 1. Multi-Layer Security
- **Database**: RLS policies prevent unauthorized access
- **API**: Authentication checks on every request
- **Frontend**: User-scoped data hooks

### 2. Data Isolation
- Users cannot see other users' data
- Users cannot modify other users' data
- Users cannot delete other users' data

### 3. Automatic Cleanup
- When a user is deleted, all their data is automatically removed
- Foreign key constraints ensure data integrity

## How to Test

### 1. Create Multiple Users
1. Register/log in as User A
2. Create some herbs, formulas, patients, prescriptions
3. Log out
4. Register/log in as User B
5. Create different data
6. Verify each user only sees their own data

### 2. Verify Data Isolation
- User A should not see User B's data
- User B should not see User A's data
- Dashboard statistics should be user-specific

### 3. Test CRUD Operations
- Create new items (should automatically include user_id)
- Update existing items (should only work on own items)
- Delete items (should only work on own items)

## Database Setup

### Run This SQL in Supabase:
```sql
-- Copy and paste the contents of secure-rls-policies.sql
-- This will set up all the necessary RLS policies
```

## Benefits

### 1. Security
- Complete data isolation between users
- No risk of data leakage
- Secure multi-tenant architecture

### 2. Performance
- Smaller data sets (only user's data)
- Faster queries
- Better caching

### 3. Scalability
- Each user's data is independent
- Easy to add more users
- No data conflicts between users

### 4. User Experience
- Clean, personalized interface
- Only relevant data shown
- Faster loading times

## Troubleshooting

### If Data Doesn't Show:
1. **Check authentication**: Ensure user is logged in
2. **Check RLS policies**: Verify policies are active
3. **Check user_id**: Ensure data has correct user_id
4. **Clear cache**: Use `invalidateAll()` function

### If Operations Fail:
1. **Check authentication**: User must be logged in
2. **Check ownership**: User can only modify their own data
3. **Check RLS policies**: Verify policies allow the operation

## Next Steps

1. **Test the application** with multiple users
2. **Verify data isolation** works correctly
3. **Monitor performance** improvements
4. **Add user management** features if needed

Your application is now fully user-specific and secure! ðŸŽ‰
